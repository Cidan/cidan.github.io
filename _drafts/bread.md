352 grams of water
6 grams of yeast
600 grams of flour
5 grams of salt
3 grams of malt syrup (1 1/2 teaspoons?)

Preferment:

Add 300 grams of flour to the mixing bowl, all of the yeast sprinkled on top, and all of the water (yes, all!) Add the malt syrup? (might need to add after preferment) You will get a pancake like mix. Cover at room temp for 8 hours with plastic wrap. After 8 hours, pour in the rest of the flour and the salt, and mix with a dough hook for 8 minutes.

Preparing:

Leave in bowl and retard the dough in the fridge for 8 hours or let rise for about 4 hours. Take dough and shape out into a rectangle. Cut in half and fold the dough over 1/3, press the seam, and fold again. Seal the seam, flatten the dough a bit, and fold over once more. Seal.

Then set the dough on the baking pan (pizza stone?) and let rise for 45 minutes (retard in fridge?). Wash. Slash. Bake at 500 for 5 minutes with boiling water steam method, then drop to 375 for 20-25 minutes.

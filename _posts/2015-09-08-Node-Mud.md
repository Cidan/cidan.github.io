I've long held a passion for MUD's; ever since I was 12 years old or so I have been playing and writing code for MUD's. I've spent a lot of time over the past two decades writing various small MUD code bases from the ground up in different languages, including C, C++, VB (I'm so sorry...), Perl, Ruby, et al.

However, after a long time, I've finally settled on a language and code base. I present, NodeMUD!
